## Introduction

**Unprompted is a powerful templating language written in Python.**

Unlike most templating languages, Unprompted was designed for **maximum readibility with natural language.** It is built around `[shortcodes]` and inspired by the likes of BBCode.

You can use Unprompted as a standalone library (e.g. `unprompted_dry.py`) or as a **superextension** for [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). The extension allows you to create expressive, re-usable prompt templates that are both versatile and easy on the eyes.

Additionally, it gives you access to **exclusive Stable Diffusion features** such as txt2mask, txt2img2img, img2pez, and more.

## Features

- **Dozens of shortcodes** provided out of the box - there are `[if]` conditionals, powerful `[file]` imports, `[for]` loops and everything else the prompting enthusiast could possibly want
- Easily extendable with **custom shortcodes**
- Simple creation of `.txt` templates that can be organized according to your preferences
- Supports recursion, nested shortcodes, advanced logic operators, custom configs, pretty much all the good stuff one might expect from a modern language
- Supports **numerous Stable Diffusion variables** such as `negative_prompt` and `cfg_scale`
- Supports natural language processing features such as auto-pluralization, finding synonyms, and even verb conjugation
- Includes a growing list of examples that demonstrate advanced functionality, such as **customizing the weight of a choice list** and **applying emphasis to a random part of your prompt**
- Comprehensive documentation that is always up-to-date
- Free
- Developed by a human

## Installation

We provide two methods of installation:

<details><summary>How to install directly... (click to expand)</summary>

1. Visit the **Extensions** tab of Automatic's WebUI.
2. Visit the **Install from URL** subtab.
3. Paste this repo's URL into the first field: `https://github.com/ThereforeGames/unprompted`
4. Click **Install**.

</details>

<details><summary>How to install through extensions index... (click to expand)</summary>

1. Visit the **Extensions** tab of Automatic's WebUI.
2. Visit the **Available** subtab.
3. Uncheck the "ads" filter and press the **Load from** button.
4. Scroll down to **Unprompted** and press the **Install** button. (Or use CTRL+F for convenience)

</details>

With either method, **please be sure to restart your WebUI after installing.** This allows Unprompted to download its Python dependencies.

## Usage

First, try the included demo template by entering the following as your prompt:

`[file common/examples/human/main]`

This is a simple "person generator" that automatically chooses characteristics like hair color, race, and posture.

The `[file]` shortcode will look in `unprompted/templates` for the specified text file (in this case `unprompted/templates/common/examples/human/main.txt`.) You do not need to enter the file extension.

**Example output:**

## Next Steps

Once you have verified that Unprompted is installed and running correctly, you have a couple options:

1. You can visit the üéì [Starter Guide](./docs/GUIDE.md) for a crash course on creating your own templates
2. Or dive into the deep end by exploring the comprehensive üìò [Manual](./docs/MANUAL.md)

## Premium Templates

While Unprompted is completely free to use, we do offer **Premium Template add-ons** that demonstrate some of the software's more advanced functionality.
